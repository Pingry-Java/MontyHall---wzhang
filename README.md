Overview
========

This program presents the famous logic puzzle, the Monty Hall problem.  The user should always switch
because you originally have a 2/3 chance of picking a goat.  Once the door is revealed, your door is still
2/3 chance of being a goat, meaning the remaining door has a 1/3 chance of being a goat, or a 2/3 chance
of being a car.
